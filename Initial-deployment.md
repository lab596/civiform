This guide is for SREs or DevOps folks.  It explains how to do an initial deployment of CiviForm into your production cloud environment.

At the time of first writing (March 2022) CiviForm has these constraints:
* Can be deployed directly into AWS, via direct AWS APIs and tools such as [cloudformation](https://github.com/seattle-uat/civiform/tree/main/infra).
* Can be deployed into Azure using [Terraform](https://github.com/seattle-uat/civiform/tree/main/cloud/azure).  _In the future, AWS deployment will also be ported to Terraform, and GCP support will likely be added._

# Deploying into AWS

TODO:  move the [Production](https://github.com/seattle-uat/civiform/wiki/Production) section over here, since it's currently AWS-specific.

# Deploying into Azure

## Forking the xxx Repository
## Setting up LoginRadius
## Setting up Azure Active Directory
## Running the Terraform Deployment Scripts
## Kicking the Tires
