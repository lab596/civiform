# Communicating with the CiviForm community

We highly recommend joining our [Slack workgroup](https://join.slack.com/t/civiform/shared_invite/zt-niap7ys1-RAICICUpDJfjpizjyjBr7Q) if you are interested in contributing. Slack makes for much quicker and easier communication than purely relying on GitHub issues.
