ZenHub does a pretty good job of two-way sync. Some quirks:

* Milestones in ZenHub map 1:1 to milestones in GitHub. ZenHub has an additional field of "start date" for milestones that aren't saved in GitHub issues, though.
* Epics in ZenHub are represented in GitHub as plain old issues with an "Epic" label.
* GitHub projects and ZenHub projects seem to be unsync-able -- neither shows up in the other's UI.
* In ZenHub, you can assign issues to Epics, but that doesn't seem to be reflected anywhere in the corresponding GitHub issue.
