## Onboarding
This is a collection of docs, links and design resources for UX as it relates to the CiviForm project. To get started, first check out the [contributing](https://github.com/seattle-uat/civiform/wiki/Contributing) wiki that has instructions on code of conduct, joining the slack group etc.

## Background and research
+ Foundational research (conducted with several intermediaries/community-based-organizations in the City of Seattle) : [tiny.cc/cvf-things](http://tiny.cc/cvf-things)
+ Sprint summary (contains core users, CUJs and 3 prototypes): [tiny.cc/cvf-sprint-recap](http://tiny.cc/cvf-sprint-recap)


## Resources
+ Wireframing kit/sample sketch file [link↗](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Z30VjV3D0UAh3Ep1B-sF58U8HVxtqTXg/view)
+ UX Design starter [tasks↗](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1bChSlWQAjyejyBdQh_jfvXEuqVPQ68AsKWFHB1DAvx0/edit#slide=id.gc75122569a_0_1564)

## Contributing
+ Use the channel `product-ux` on the team slack for UX discussion & updates.
+ Miro: [tiny.cc/cvf-flow](http://tiny.cc/cvf-flow) is our main interface for design output and collaboration (comments, mockups etc.). Use the cvf-flow project to create boards, add screenshots/images/links to mockups/prototypes and for comments. Anything that can be translated here through a screenshot should, but if you link out to a prototype or mockup, please make sure it's publicly accessible.
+ Tasks are listed as Github under the `UX` label [here](https://github.com/seattle-uat/civiform/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3AUX).  We do try to keep some labeled as `good first issue`
+ There's a `Design & UX` Folder in the team [Google Drive](https://github.com/seattle-uat/civiform/wiki/Google-Drive) that can be used to store any source assets.
