# Vision

CiviForm aspires to become:

> An open-source product suite that's the easiest way for civic entities and community-based organizations to deploy public benefit programs to the cloud.

This suite will consist of several products:

- A platform to make the discovery of benefit programs easier (a new product we will build in the future)
- A product to improve the process of apply for benefit programs (the current CiviForm)


# Product Roadmap

We will launch a "Minimum Viable Product" of CiviForm by June 30th, 2021, when the Google.org Fellowship team completes their work. But there are many, many additional features we'd like to add throughout 2021 and beyond.

Many of the more granular tasks are in the ["Icebox"](https://github.com/seattle-uat/civiform/milestone/8) here on GitHub. At a higher level, our roadmap until the end of 2021 includes:

## End-of-2021 roadmap

CiviForm's roadmap for July to December 2021 is focused around 3 key pillars:

### Improving applicant experience
- Providing visual indicators of remaining questions until completion
- Additional language support in the applicant experience beyond the eight Tier-1 languages here.
- Homepage features to improve discovery of relevant programs
- Image support in question descriptions
- Physical address verification
- PDF export for "print and finish on paper"
- Integrating eligibility rules to display likelihood of application approval
- Displaying application post-submission status as provided by program administrators
- Automated reminders when residents need to re-apply
- Notifications for residents when there are new programs they are likely eligible for
- Support for programs in higher jurisdictions

### Increasing program administrator efficiency
- Shared application review capability between programs to reduce duplicate administrative work e.g. an admin of one program verifying income marks the applicant's income verified for all programs
- UI for admins to design eligibility criteria to support eligibility features in applicant experience
- APIs for Seattle IT to integrate CiviForm with existing CRM and automation applications

### Adoption & usage by Trusted Intermediaries
- Ability for applicants to provide access to existing accounts to TIs for assistance in application completion
- Dashboards for impact and other reports 

## Ongoing work 

Some work will continue to be necessary throughout 2021 and beyond:

- Fix usability issues and unforeseen bugs
- Add / improve questions types to improve data capture quality and adjust to unforeseen question types with new/modified eligibility requirements.
- Security patches and upgrades to 3rd party `software dependencies
- Custom queries and data compliance tasks
- Monitoring and adjusting AWS resources based on utilization
