Work in Progress

User created data (Questions, Programs, Applications) are all versioned and this doc discusses the versioning mechanism and the data life cycle that drives it 


## Questions and Program

### Conceptual Overview

#### Versions

Conceptually versioning is done at the system level with all modified data advancing to a new version system-wide together.  It is most correct, and less confusing, to talk about Questions and Program instances as being *associated* with a version; rather than having a version themselves.

#### Lifecycle

a Question or Program can conceptually be in one of three states: ACTIVE, DRAFT, DELETED.
