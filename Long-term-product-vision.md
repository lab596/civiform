# Vision

CiviForm aspires to become:

> An open-source product suite that's the easiest way for civic entities and community-based organizations to deploy public benefit programs to the cloud.

This suite will consist of several products:

- A platform to make the discovery of benefit programs easier (a new product we will build in the future)
- A product to improve the process of apply for benefit programs (the current CiviForm)
