## Check Questions For Missing Enumerators

This query checks if active version questions are bound to enumerators that are missing. The `is_enumerator_missing` column will be `true` if the enumerator does not exist in the questions table.

```sql
select
    v.id as versions_id,
    v.lifecycle_stage as versions_lifecycle_stage,
    q.id as questions_id,
    q.name as question_name,
    q.question_type,
    q.enumerator_id,
    case when eq.id is null then true else false end as is_enumerator_missing
from questions as q
inner join versions_questions as vq
    on vq.questions_id = q.id
inner join versions as v
    on vq.versions_id = v.id
left join questions as eq
    on q.enumerator_id = eq.id
where q.enumerator_id is not null
and eq.id is null
and v.lifecycle_stage = 'active'
order by v.id desc
```


## Check Programs for Missing Questions

This query flattens out the program block_definitions json. The `debug_notes` column will provide a message describing problems that were found.

The query debug_notes currently checks if
* questionDefinition points to a question that doesn't exist
* questionDefinition enumerator points to a question that doesn't exist
* hidePredicate points to a question that doesn't exist
