## Contributing
+ Use the channel `#product-ux` on the team slack for UX discussion & updates.
+ Miro: [tiny.cc/cvf-flow](http://tiny.cc/cvf-flow) is our main interface for design output and collaboration (comments, mockups etc.). Use the cvf-flow project to create boards, add screenshots/images/links to mockups/prototypes and for comments. Anything that can be translated here through a screenshot should, but if you link out to a prototype or mockup, please make sure it's publicly accessible.
+ Tasks are listed as Github under the `UX` label [here](https://github.com/seattle-uat/civiform/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3AUX).  We do try to keep some labeled as `good first issue`, which are great for first-time contributors.  Feel free to ask in Slack if you don't see any good first time issues to tackle.
+ There's a `Design & UX` Folder in the team [Google Drive](https://github.com/seattle-uat/civiform/wiki/Google-Drive) that can be used to store any source assets.
