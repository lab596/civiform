ZenHub is a workspace bolted on top of GitHub that adds native support for epics, sprints, roadmapping, etc. Everyone with write access to this GitHub repo will also have access to the corresponding ZenHub by default. Here's what to do:

* [Visit this page](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/uat-5ff8b877951e50001475fadd/board?repos=327165048)
* Authenticate with your GitHub account
* Start working on issues/milestones/etc.

Everything is synced back-and-forth between GitHub and ZenHub, so you can make artifacts on either.
