If you'd like to help design the user interface (UI) for various Civiform pages and widgets, here's where you'll find key resources and guides.

## High-fidelity mockups

One way you can contribute to the UI effort is to create high-fidelity, (mostly) pixel-perfect mockups of what various screens should look like. As an example, one contributor made [excellent mockups of part of the application flow](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lXULxwE=/?moveToWidget=3074457357026727270&cot=14). Once you've created these resources, we'll send them off to our engineering team to help them as they build out the UI.

To get started, see instructions on the [UX guide](/UX-contribution-guide). Your main contributions will be put on our Miro board ([tiny.cc/cvf-flow](tiny.cc/cvf-flow)), so look for those guidelines on that page.
